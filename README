[x]:tab: A Pivot Table Application

=============================


[x]:tab is a Play application

Visit https://www.playframework.com/ for more information



Make sure you have a postgreSQL database. Visit https://www.postgresql.org/ for more info.

 Once postgres is installed, create a database called 'pivottable'

whose owner is a user called 'test' with the password 'test', or modify the information in conf/application.conf to match your database setup.

In general,
please explore conf/application.conf to adapt it to your specific needs

.

Two methods are available to launch the application using this code:



Launch in development mode

==========================


1. You will need to download Activator on this page
: https://playframework.com/download#activator


2. Then you will need to add activator to your path:

	On Unix, use export PATH=/path/to/activator:$PATH
On
	Windows, add ;C:\path\to\activator to your PATH environment variable. Do not use a path with spaces.


3. On your Terminal/Command Prompt move to the folder containing this project
(where this READ ME file is located),
type export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx8g" to expand
the available RAM to be used by the application and then type 'activator run'


4. On your browser of choice, go to: localhost:9000


5. A red page might prompt you to do an 'Evolution' to the database. Click 'Apply this script now!'
This will generate all the tables required to run the
application correctly.


6. Before trying to log in, use the script conf/import.sql and run it on the database 'pivottable'.


7. Log in using the username 'test.user@gmail.com' and the password 'MegaXTabPassword'. Actual user management
will be added in a later version.


8. Type Ctrl+D to stop the running application



Launch in production mode

=========================


1. Load the file target/universal/pivot-table-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip to your server (type 'activator dist' to generate a new
 one if the code was modified)

.
2. Unzip this file on your server


3. Your server must be able to run Java 8 applications. Move to the folder pivot-table-1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin


4. As usual, make sure your server is running PostrgreSQL and contains the database 'pivottable' locally.


5. Type the following command:
sudo ./pivot-table -Dhttp.port=9000 -DapplyEvolutions.default=true -J-Xmx8G &


6. If there is a problem, you might need to restart the application. Kill the process running on port 9000, if
 necessary, and delete the file RUNNING_PID
located in the folder pivot-table-1.0-SNAPSHOT before relaunching.


7. Before trying to log in, use the script conf/import.sql and run it on the database 'pivottable'.


8. Login using the username 'test.user@gmail.com' and the password 'MegaXTabPassword'. Actual user management
will be added in a later version.




Notes:

=====

- For CSV files, before running the application, change 'file.system.root' in conf/application.conf to
match the path where a copy  of the uploaded CSV
files will be saved for future use.


- CSV Files must be pretty standard: commas as separators. Quote handling is already taken into account.


- This application can connect to most of the stated databases present in the SRS. You just need to
 enter the appropriate parameters in the connection form.
